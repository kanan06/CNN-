ABSTRACT
Lung cancer is one of the major causes of cancer-related 
deaths due to its aggressive nature  and delayed detections at 
advanced stages. Early detection of lung cancer is very 
important for the  survival of an individual, and is a significant
challenging problem. At early stages, the benign and the 
malignant nodules show very close resemblance to each other.
In this project, a novel deep learning-based model with 
multiple strategies is proposed for the precise diagnosis of the
malignant nodules. Due to the recent achievements of deep 
convolution neural networks  (CNN) in image analysis, we 
have used two deep three-dimensional (3D) customized mixed 
link  network (CMixNet) architectures for lung nodule detection and classification, respectively.
